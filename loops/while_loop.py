#Suppose that a machine sells bottles of Coca-Cola (Coke) for

#  one at a time, each time informing the user of the amount due.
# Once the user has inputted at least 50 cents, output how many cents in change the user is owed.
# Assume that the user will only input integers, and ignore any integer that isnâ€™t an accepted denomination.

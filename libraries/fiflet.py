#FIGlet, named after Frank, Ian, and Glenâ€™s letters, is a program from the early 1990s for making large letters
# out of ordinary text, a form of ASCII art:

#Among the fonts supported by FIGlet are those at figlet.org/examples.html.
#FIGlet has since been ported to Python as a module called pyfiglet.
#In a file called figlet.py, implement a program that:

#Expects zero or two command-line arguments:
#Zero if the user would like to output text in a random font.
#Two if the user would like to output text in a specific font, in which case the first of the two should be -f or --font,
#  and the second of the two should be the name of the font.
#Prompts the user for a str of text.
#Outputs that text in the desired font.
#If the user provides two command-line arguments and the first is not -f or --font or the second is not the name of a font,
# the program should exit via sys.exit with an error message.

#In a file called outdated.py, implement a program that prompts the user for a date, anno Domini, in month-day-year order,
# formatted like 9/8/1636 or September 8, 1636, wherein the month in the latter might be any of the values in the list below:

d={
    "january" : "01",
    "February" : "02",
    "March" : "03",
    "April" : "04",
    "May" : "05",
    "June" : "06",
    "July" : "07",
    "August" : "08",
    "September" : "09",
    "October" : "10",
    "November" : "11",
    "December" : "12"
}

#Then output that same date in YYYY-MM-DD format. If the userâ€™s input is not a valid date in either format, prompt the user again.
# Assume that every month has no more than 31 days; no need to validate whether a month has 28, 29, 30, or 31 days.
